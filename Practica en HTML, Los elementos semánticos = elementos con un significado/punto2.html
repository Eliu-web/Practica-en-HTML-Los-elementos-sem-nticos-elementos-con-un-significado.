  <p>My little pony, ×2
    Ah~🎶 ah~🎶 ah~🎶 ah~🎶
    My little pony, I wondered what friendship was
    (My little pony) Until their magic they wanted to give me
    Adventure and fun, he is strong and faithful, with a big heart.
    Being kind is the solution
    Magic makes it even better
    Because it's my little pony
    And forever there will be a great friendship 🎶</p>
